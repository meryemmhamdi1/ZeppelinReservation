# ZeppelinReservation

This project was done in collaboration with Software Engineering II teammates Samir Rouini and Mohammed Tahri Sqalli.
The system’s main goal is to manage the following modules:
    •	Customer information
    •	Flight information 
    •	Reservations and cancellations
    •	Report creation 
    
This solution was implemented using ASP.NET technologies and sql server to manage the system's database.
